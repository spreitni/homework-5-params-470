i spent 8 hours on this assignment
i think i earned a b
i think i deserve an a
i was confused on the question, it could take in more than 1 parameter from what it looks like with out changing the code. 
but im guessing its because params is appened to the front of the list from no-code
My first idea was to try to use length to determine if there was more than just variavle in the call function. if so walk through it
but it would crash because length wants a list and in the body of the function there was only 1 value and it was not a list. i figured i needed more recursion so i called 
no-parser again but i couldnt get it to keep going through with out adding another recursion loop and adding another cdr.
